    # 1. THE "GOLDEN" RESOLUTION (The exact incident match)
    # ==========================================
    add_faq(
        "Incident Resolution",
        "We are seeing a massive spike in payment_gateway_latency_ms and PaymentGatewayTimeoutExceptions right after a new release went out. What is the emergency runbook?",
        "This is a critical severity issue. First, confirm the timestamp of the recent CI/CD pipeline deployment. Immediately trigger a rollback to the previous known-good commit via the deployment pipeline. Do not wait to debug the code. Once the rollback completes, monitor 'payment_gateway_latency_ms' in Grafana to ensure it drops back below 400ms. Finally, run the payment reconciliation script to refund or re-process any transactions that hung during the incident window."

    # 2. LATENCY "RED HERRINGS" (Natural phrasing)
    # ==========================================
    add_faq(
        "Latency Issues",
        "Users are complaining about checkout timeouts and PaymentGatewayTimeoutException, but nobody has deployed any code today. What do we check?",
        "If there were no recent deployments, the issue is likely upstream. Check the status page of our payment provider immediately. If they are reporting an outage or degraded performance, use LaunchDarkly to toggle the active payment route to our fallback provider. If the upstream provider looks healthy, check our AWS NAT Gateway metrics to see if we are dropping outbound packets."

    add_faq(
        "Database",
        "I'm looking at Datadog and db_query_latency_ms is sitting above 300ms. Queries seem really sluggish. How do I troubleshoot?",
        "Log into the primary PostgreSQL database and run a query against pg_stat_activity to hunt for long-running transactions or deadlocks. If you notice sequential scans happening on the 'orders' table, it's possible a recent migration accidentally dropped an index. Running VACUUM ANALYZE might also clear up stale statistics causing poor query plans."
    )

    add_faq(
        "Caching",
        "Redis latency is spiking and checkout is slow. We are seeing a lot of cache misses. What's the fix?",
        "Take a look at the Redis memory metrics in AWS ElastiCache. If 'evicted_keys' is climbing rapidly, the cache has hit its capacity and is thrashing. You need to either increase the maxmemory limit on the Redis cluster or shorten the TTL (Time To Live) on the cart_session keys to free up space."
